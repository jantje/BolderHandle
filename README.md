# BolderHandle
Software to control bike esc's to steer a bolder cart only based on holding the handle

The idea is to have a handle that can extend and shorten and based on the size difference the bike esc's are driven
The esc's are driven with pwm pin to speed wire (maybe a RC filter os neded) and digital pin to the break wire

If I can get this to pull off there are 2 things to be added
Breaks (my current esc break is not strong enough nor does it break when standing still)
Reverse drive
